              I’m from a middle-class family of kwara, I am Jimoh Israel. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. I have a wonderful family and love all my family members.
              My family consists of six members – parents, two sisters, one brother and me.
              My father is a businessman and my mother is a school teacher by profession. They both love their occupation. That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose.
              All my family members love, respect and care for each other.

              These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind, I have always desired to serve my people in whatever capacity I can.
